CyaSSL Embedded SSL Library Android NDK Package

This is a Android NDK package of the CyaSSL Embedded SSL library, which 
also includes a CTaoCrypt test application.  It should be helpful to Android
developers who are embedding the CyaSSL library into NDK applications.

By default, this package builds the CyaSSL library as a static library,
which is needed in order to be linked to the TestCTaoCrypt application's 
native library (libctctest.so). It should be trivial to build a shared 
CyaSSL library, if need be.

===========================================================================
REQUIREMENTS:

Before building or installing this package, you must have the Android SDK
and NDK installed and set up on your system.

===========================================================================
BUILDING:

To build and install this package, run:

android update project -p . -s
ndk-build
ant debug

===========================================================================
INSTALLING:

To install this package in a running Android emulator, run:

ant install

When the example application (TestCTaoCrypt) is run, it first installs
required test certificates on the SD card of the emulator, under the
/certs directory (/sdcard/certs). Make sure your emulator is equipped
with an SD card before running TestCTaoCrypt.
